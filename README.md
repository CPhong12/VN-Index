The Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on VN-Index
Objective
This project aims to measure and analyze the impact of key macroeconomic factors such as oil prices, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rates, and gold prices on the VN-Index. We intend to provide insights into how these factors affect the stock market both in the short term and long term.

Dataset
Data Source: Data will be collected from reputable sources such as the State Bank of Vietnam, the General Statistics Office, and stock exchanges.
Time Range: From 2013 to December 2023.
Main Variables:
VN-Index: Vietnam's stock market index.
Oil Price: Brent crude oil price.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product growth rate.
CPI: Consumer Price Index, measuring inflation levels.
Exchange Rate: USD/VND exchange rate.
Gold Price: International and domestic gold prices.
Methodology
Correlation Analysis: Measure the correlation between macroeconomic factors and the VN-Index.
Linear Regression Model: Build regression models to predict the impact of each factor on the VN-Index.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce data dimensionality to identify the most influential factors.
Stationarity Tests: Use tests like ADF and KPSS to check the stability of the data.
ARIMA and VAR Models: Analyze the long-term and short-term impacts of the factors on the VN-Index.
Results
Correlation Analysis: Display the correlation levels between each macroeconomic factor and the VN-Index.
Regression Models: Identify the most influential factors affecting the VN-Index.
Forecast: Use the ARIMA model to forecast the future trend of the VN-Index based on macroeconomic factors.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive view of the influence of macroeconomic factors on the VN-Index, helping investors and stakeholders gain deeper insights and better directions for stock market investments in Vietnam.
